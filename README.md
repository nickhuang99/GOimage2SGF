# **Go Environment Manager (GEM) v1.0.0**

A command-line tool to analyze Go board positions from images or live webcams, manage SGF files, and assist in game recording, featuring a robust, adaptive board detection algorithm.

## **üöÄ Quick Start: Hello World**

This guide will get you from a checkout to a successfully detected board in two commands.

### **Prerequisites**

* **Hardware**: A webcam.  
* **Software**: g++, pkg-config, libopencv4-dev, libv4l-dev.  
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libopencv-dev pkg-config libv4l-dev

### **Step 1: Build the Application**

Clone the repository and run the build script.  
./build.sh

This creates the gem.exe executable.

### **Step 2: Calibrate the Board**

This is the "Hello World" step. Place your Go board in front of the camera with **four stones** on the corner intersections:

* **Black** stones at the Top-Left (TL) and Bottom-Left (BL) corners.  
* **White** stones at the Top-Right (TR) and Bottom-Right (BR) corners.

Then, run the **auto-calibration** command:  
./gem.exe \-A

The application will automatically capture an image, detect the board and corner stones, sample the colors, and save a complete share/config.txt file. It will also save a raw snapshot to share/snapshot\_raw\_calibration.jpg.

### **Step 3: Verify the Result**

To see the board detection in action on the image you just took, run:  
./gem.exe \--image ./share/snapshot\_raw\_calibration.jpg \--detect-board

An OpenCV window will appear showing the captured image with the detected board outline drawn in green, confirming that the core feature of the project is working perfectly.

## **üåü Features**

* **Robust Board Detection**:  
  * **Pass 1 (Rough Detection)**: Uses find\_board\_quadrilateral\_rough to find all plausible 4-sided shapes in the image, creating a list of board candidates.  
  * **Pass 2 (Adaptive Refinement)**: The core of the application's intelligence. For each candidate, it performs the following:  
    * **Primary** Method **(High-Quality Images)**: It first attempts a fast and high-precision detection using goodFeaturesToTrack to find grid intersections. A strict quality check ensures this method only succeeds on clear, high-contrast images.  
    * **Fallback Method (Challenging Images)**: If the primary method fails, it automatically switches to a robust fallback strategy.  
      * **Enhanced Pre-processing**: Uses **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) and **Bilateral Filtering** to dramatically improve local contrast and reduce noise in poorly lit images.  
      * **Masked Line Search**: Uses the rough shape from Pass 1 to create a **mask**, ensuring the Hough Line Transform only searches for grid lines *inside* the board, ignoring background noise.  
      * **K-Means Clustering**: The cleaned-up horizontal and vertical lines are clustered using cv::kmeans to find the 19 center points for each axis, providing a highly accurate and noise-resistant grid definition.  
* **Full Calibration Suite**:  
  * **Automatic Calibration (-A)**: The recommended one-shot method to get started.  
  * **Interactive Calibration (-B)**: A user-friendly GUI to manually adjust corners and save a configuration, ideal for tricky setups.  
* **SGF & Game Management**:  
  * **Tournament Mode (-t)**: A guided workflow to record a live game step-by-step, capturing images and appending moves to a master tournament.sgf file.  
  * **Study** Mode **(-u)**: A replay tool to step through a recorded game, showing the board state and the corresponding snapshot for each move.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Building**

The project uses a simple build script and relies on pkg-config to find the necessary OpenCV 4 libraries.  
\# Ensure you have the required dependencies installed  
\# sudo apt-get install build-essential libopencv-dev pkg-config libv4l-dev

\# Run the build script from the project root  
./build.sh
