# GOimage2SGF 

using GO board image to generate SGF file to record game play

This is probably a pioneered project such that it is almost purely 
done by AI in a sense that I, as human, only give idea and instruction 
to AI(in this case, it is Gemini from Google) to do the real coding. Of 
course, occasianlly I also give direct order to which direction the coding 
should go. Also I actively work as project leader, testing planner, debugging
helper to assist Gemini by providing compiling error, running result, and
debugging image uploading. This work cycle repeats for hundreds of times and 
finally it begins to work.

## Why ##
A friend of mine wants to develop a special machine to record game playing of GO 
by using webcam. So, we need to transfer image of board of GO into a state of game 
playing in SGF format.
